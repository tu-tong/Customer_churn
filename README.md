Analyze customer churn for Telco

In this project, I am using IBM Telco customers dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassanelfattmi/ibm-telco-customer-churn-why-do-customers-leave/notebook) to analyze trends and patterns of Telco customers. Then, I use both logistic regression and random forest model to predict customer status (whether they leave Telco or decide to stay).
